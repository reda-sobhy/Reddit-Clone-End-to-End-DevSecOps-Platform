# 🚀 Reddit Clone – DevSecOps Platform on **AWS EKS | Jenkins CI | ArgoCD GitOps | Security Scanning | Observability**

An end-to-end **DevSecOps platform** that demonstrates how to build, secure, deploy, and observe a cloud-native application using **CI/CD, GitOps, Kubernetes, and AWS**.  
This project was built collaboratively and focuses on **production-style architecture and best practices**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This platform automates the full lifecycle of a Reddit Clone application:

- Infrastructure provisioning using **Terraform**
- Secure **CI pipeline** with Jenkins and multiple security gates
- **GitOps-based CD** using ArgoCD
- Deployment on **AWS EKS**
- **Monitoring & observability** with Prometheus and Grafana

Git is used as the **single source of truth**, ensuring consistency, traceability, and automated recovery.
